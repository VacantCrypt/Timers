Simple Timer Program.

Open source feel free to do what you want to change it

Currently opens timers window that will stay on top of any screen and a blank cmd window. Right click open with python

Feel free to disable the CMD window from popping up if you know how to do so with use of BAT files, I just minimize it.

All you need to run it is python which for windows users should be free in the windows store. 

I Have not tested on Mac / Lynix 

If there is enough demand for whatever reason, I could make it an exe file. But I perfer it just be a py file so everyone can read what it is doing. 

Anything that doesn't make sence feel free to reach out in game to TheVacantCrypt Gengod or Fira en Gravonere
